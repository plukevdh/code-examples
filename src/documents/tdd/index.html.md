# TDD

This example is broken up a little bit so that you can see all the parts and be certain that it works. [The Tutoria][1] is the steps we walk through to get from no code
to a fully-functioning program. [The Final Example][2] is a simple demo using the library code we are writing and testing to prove that the tests fit our working model. [The Specs][3] is the jasmine standalone spec runner so that you can visualize how the specs are running and what it looks like when they don't pass.
